<h2 align="left">Anatomy of My Website</h2>
<h4>Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?</h4>

<br>The HTML concept can be viewed in the entire website field including
index.html, vince.html, aboutme.html, and resume.html. 
<p>The CSS concept is assigned for the media queries, position of the pictures and texts, and responsive design of the website.
<p>Lastly, there are some JS concepts were added to have an appealing responsive design and animations. I also cited the respective owners
of the fonts and animations that I used on my website.</br></p>

<h4>What was your inspiration for the design of the website?</h4>

<br>The design inspiration for my website draws heavily from the Riot Games website, it's where I've spent a bunch of time playing my all-time favorite games.
The way they make everything so immersive and easy to use just stuck with me. So, I'm hoping to bring that same cool mix of creativity, clarity, and functionality to my site. 
I want other users to feel as excited and into it as I do when I'm on the Riot Games platform.</br>

<h4>What was your approach in creating the content of the website?</h4>

<br>When I am working on my website, I have divided the process into smaller tasks that I learn each day by reviewing the given tutorials and links on how to create a website. 
It is impossible for me to complete this entire website in one day, so breaking it down and spreading it out over a timeline makes it much more manageable. 
This approach allows me to focus on the small details without feeling overwhelmed.</br>

<h4>How is your website creative?</h4>
<br>I find designing the layout of my website creative and simple while experimenting with various principles and responsive design to be enjoyable. 
This enables me to display my skills and experiences in an engaging and visually attractive way, ensuring that the users find the content interesting.</br>'

<h4>What did you use to deploy your website?</h4>

<br>I use Visual Studio Code to carefully develop the important code that will be used on my website. I find its user-friendly interface and powerful features very helpful to help me
develop my website as well as test the website easily. In addition, I use GitHub to create a repository where I can organize and store all the files used in my website development. 
With just a click, I can commit and push the changes seamlessly. </br>
